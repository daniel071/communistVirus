# Communist Virus
## WARNING: ⚠️ I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE CAUSED TO ANY DEVICE ⚠️
Communist Virus is a simple program in mainly batch script that changes your background and plays russian music!
I made this program for fun, it doesn't do anything harmful (except shut down your computer). The `Virus_Testing` folder
was me testing different scripts. The `All_Virus_Contents` folder is where the installer is located. This is what
is in the releases.
